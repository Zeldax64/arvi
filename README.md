# ARVI
A simple RISC-V I implementation in Verilog.

## Project now
The project is a single-cycle processor implementing "I" instruction set. It is not yet finished because it is still necessary to implement machine mode and interrupt support. Many things may change here :D

## Objectives
1. Finish RISC-V I implementation;
2. Run Zephyr OS;
3. Synthetize to FPGA;
4. Build pipeline;

## Dependencies
1. verilator
2. riscv-fesvr

## Command line arguments
#### -v
Generate VCD file. No vcd file is generated by default.

#### +max-cycles=
Max number of cycles that the processor will run.

#### +loadmem=
Elf file to be loaded. This parameter must be passed.

## Make commands
#### all
    $make all
Compile necessary files using to create an executable program.

#### regression-tests
    $make regression-tests

Run all tests in tb/tests.
