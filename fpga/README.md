This folder contains all files necessary to handle synthesis targeting FPGA. The folder is divided in three subfolders:

- ip: Store IPs that can be used in FPGA.
- part: Contain all available targets (FPGA or boards).
- scripts: FPGA synthesis scripts.

Only basys3 board is currently supported and a simple blink program is available to it.
